* [VMWare Workstation Pro (Trial)](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/en/downloads/info/slug/desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_pro/16_0)
* [VMware Fusion for Mac (Free)](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/get-download?downloadGroup=FUS-PUBTP-2021H1)

You might also consider joining your local [VMUG](https://www.vmug.com/membership/vmug-advantage-membership/).

## Download, Import, Setup SKILSTAK Boost VM (OVA File)

1. Download the [OVA][] file
2. Optionally [validate the checksum](#optional-checksum-validation)
3. Download and install Oracle VirtualBox
4. Double click the [OVA][] file to open and import into VirtualBox
5. Login as user `boost` with password `password`
6. Note the IP address 
7. Connect from Windows Terminal or iTerm2 using `ssh boost@<ipaddress>`
8. Consider adding a "Reserved DHCP Address" to your home rounter so IP stays the same

## Network Troubleshooting

> "For me, at boot the VM could not connect to a network. I had to go to vmware virtual machine settings, network adapter and for bridged mode -> configure adapters and uncheck VirtualBox Host-Only ethernet adapter." (mecena38) (This seems to be common for those using VMWare Player who had VirtualBox before.)

> "sudo /sbin/dhclient" (10x_programmer) (This will sometimes get you a first IP if none was assigned. It should remember it after the first time.)

## Optional Checksum Validation

For those who know what sha256sum is and how to validate it here is the checksum:

```
119340D890EDD11A0BA914804CEBBC68F9DF507C53035FFBA5DD577DF890C445
```

For those who don't know what a checksum is (yet) don't worry about it for now. Eventually, you will be able to use this to validate that a time is the authentic original and not been tampered with in transit or put on a phishing server to hack you.

## Setup

This repo contains the setup script to create a fresh SKILSTAK Beginner
Boost Ubuntu Server virtual machine. Most will never need it and can
just use the [OVA] file.  But for those who want to make their own
simply install Ubuntu Server and run the script within this repo to
setup the server and install everything.

> ðŸ’€DANGER: This script is highly destructive! Piping this (or any
> random script from the Internet) and running as root with bash is
> a horrible idea unless you know what every line of the script does. DO
> NOT RUN THIS ON A SYSTEM YOU CARE ABOUT! It is for beginner training
> only and even then is primarily used to create safe training virtual
> machines that should be downloaded and used instead of this script.
