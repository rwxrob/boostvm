## Setup

This repo contains the setup script to create a fresh SKILSTAK Beginner
Boost Ubuntu Server virtual machine. Most will never need it and can
just use the [OVA] file.  But for those who want to make their own
simply install Ubuntu Server and run the script within this repo to
setup the server and install everything.

> ðŸ’€DANGER: This script is highly destructive! Piping this (or any
> random script from the Internet) and running as root with bash is
> a horrible idea unless you know what every line of the script does. DO
> NOT RUN THIS ON A SYSTEM YOU CARE ABOUT! It is for beginner training
> only and even then is primarily used to create safe training virtual
> machines that should be downloaded and used instead of this script.
